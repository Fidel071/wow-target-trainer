# 🎯 Target Trainer (WoW Addon)

![Target Trainer Screenshot](screenshots/preview1.png)

**Practice your target keybinds with a fun training mini-game.**  
Target Trainer highlights a random party frame (Tank, Self, DPS1, DPS2, DPS3) and you must press your *real* target keybinds to hit the right one. Improve your reflexes, train your muscle memory, and level up your accuracy!

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Uses your **actual keybinds** (`Target Party Member 1–4`, `Target Self`) – no hardcoded keys.
- ✅ Practice mode with **progress, level, and streak tracking**.
- ✅ **Hardcore Mode**: push yourself with no mistakes allowed (see below 👇).
- ✅ **Movable & resizable** window – drag with **Shift + Left-click**.
- ✅ **Layout options**: vertical or horizontal stacking.
- ✅ **Local leaderboard** – tracks your top 5 runs.
- ✅ Sounds and HUD feedback for hits, misses, timeouts, and level-ups.

---

## 💀 Hardcore Mode — Test Your Skill
Looking for a real challenge?  
Turn on Hardcore mode with:

/tt hardcore on

- In Hardcore, **one wrong press or a single timeout resets you back to Level 1**.
